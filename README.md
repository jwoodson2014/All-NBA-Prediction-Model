# All-NBA Prediciton Model

For my final group project in my Data Programming in R class, I had the opportunity to create a model that predicts the 15 players that will be selected to the All-NBA teams in any season

- Background
  - Chose a gradient boosted machine to train model
  - Model was built with a mix of traditional and advamced statistics for all players from 1980-2021
  - The model predicts 3 centers, 6 forwards, and 6 guards
